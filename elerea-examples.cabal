Name:                elerea-examples
Version:             1.0.2
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.2
Synopsis:            Example applications for Elerea
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:

  Example applications for Elerea. They are factored out into their
  own package so as to avoid unnecessary dependencies in the
  library. Check out the @doc@ directory for the colourful literate
  sources.
  .
  The programs included are the following:
  .
  * chase: a minimal example that demonstrates reactivity and mutually
    recursive signals
  .
  * breakout: a not too fancy breakout clone that also demonstrates
    Graphviz output; you can get an SVG rendition of the signal
    structure with the following command if Graphviz is installed:
    @elerea-breakout --dump-dot | dot -Tsvg -o breakout.svg@
