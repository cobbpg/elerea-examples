Example applications for Elerea. They are factored out into their own
package so as to avoid unnecessary dependencies in the library. Check
out the doc directory for the colourful literate sources.

The programs included are the following:

* bounce: an example for creating dynamic collections of signals; left
  click to create balls, drag existing balls with left button to
  propel them and drag with right to select balls for deletion (upon
  release);

* chase: a minimal example that demonstrates reactivity and mutually
  recursive signals;

* breakout: a not too fancy breakout clone; you can simply use the
  mouse to move the paddle.
